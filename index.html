            <p class="bio-box">I am Dylan Schroeder. I am from a <em>very</em>
            small town called Clarence Iowa. As a lifetime lover of video
            games I knew that is something I wanted to do. I got a video game
            design degree from Full Sail University, but knew I needed a little
            more education to really get where I want to me. So that is why I am
            here with DeltaV!</p>
